# Synthesizer
Command line application synthesising input text.


This application is relaint on the file 'simpleaudio.py' in order to do some background processing of the audio. This is not my file/code so I cannot upload it. I plan to replace this reliance with my own code which has the same functionality. However, until then, this application won't be functional (other than on my local desktop which has the 'simpleaudio.py' file).
